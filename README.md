**Wisp** turns any conversation into a clean, timestamped, speaker-labelled transcript in real time — and runs a live AI assistant alongside it. Every byte of audio and every model stays on your device by default. It installs in seconds, needs **zero** extra setup (no virtual audio drivers, no kernel extensions), and is tuned to the metal on each platform — Metal + the Neural Engine on Apple Silicon, native loopback on Windows.

## 🎙️ The live meeting copilot

This is the heart of Wisp — and it's fast.

- **Streaming transcript, sub-second.** Words appear as they're spoken (live partials → finalized lines), each timestamped. No "press stop to see the result."
- **Knows who's talking.** On-device diarization labels every line live — **You** vs **Them**, or **Speaker 1 / 2 / 3** — with running speaker centroids that stay stable across a long call.
- **Captures *both* sides.** Your microphone and the meeting's system audio are fused onto a single timeline, with **WebRTC AEC3 echo cancellation** so the remote voices don't bleed back through your mic. One click — no loopback driver to install.
- **🤖 AI Assist — your second brain in the call.** A live copilot panel that streams as it thinks:
  - **Rolling summaries**, **action items**, **decisions**, and **open questions** that update as the meeting unfolds
  - **Follow-up email** drafts, ready to send
  - **Real-time hints** and service-industry templates — sales coaching, support guidance, live sentiment/tone monitoring
  - Diarization-aware context so it knows *who* said *what*, with controlled cadence so it's helpful, not noisy

> Bring your own LLM endpoint (local or cloud) — the assistant is model-agnostic and fully parameterized (temperature, penalties, max tokens, and more).

## 📄 State-of-the-art file transcription

Drop in any audio or video file and get a transcript you can trust:

- **Accuracy-first by default** — Whisper **large-v3-turbo**, with heavier or quantized variants a click away.
- **Speaker diarization** — *who* said *what*, with **word-level timestamps** and per-word speaker attribution.
- **Custom vocabulary / term biasing** — feed in names, products, and jargon so they transcribe correctly.
- **Cleaner audio in** — neural denoising and VAD gating drop non-speech before the model sees it.
- **Optional local LLM cleanup** — tidy punctuation and disfluencies without leaving the device.
- **Structured Markdown export** — summary, speakers, and a timestamped timeline, ready to share.
- **Live progress** even on opaque decode phases, so you're never staring at a frozen bar.

## 🧠 A private, searchable memory

Every meeting Wisp transcribes is saved to a **local notes library** — and you can search across all of them by *meaning*, fully on-device.

- **Semantic + keyword, fused.** Search *"the budget discussion"* and Wisp finds the right note even if those exact words were never spoken — SQLite FTS5 keyword matching fused with vector similarity (hybrid). Every hit shows *why* it matched: keyword highlights and a semantic confidence score.
- **SOTA local embeddings — your pick.** Download, switch, and delete on-device embedding models right in Settings:
  - **Qwen3-Embedding 0.6B** — a state-of-the-art instruction-tuned **decoder** embedder
  - **BGE-M3** — 1024-dim, 100+ languages, strong CJK
  - plus **GTE multilingual**, **Multilingual E5** (small / base / large), and **BGE-Chinese**
  
  Switching models re-indexes your library **atomically** — an interrupted or failed switch never corrupts the existing index.
- **Nothing leaves the device.** Notes are embedded and searched locally through ONNX Runtime. Prefer a hosted embedder for a job? OpenAI-compatible cloud models are **opt-in**, with your own key.

## 🔒 Local-first & genuinely private

Transcription, diarization, denoising, and VAD all run **on-device** through `sherpa-onnx` and Metal/ANE — no audio ever touches a network. Models are pulled from Hugging Face **only when you choose to install them**, then cached locally.

Need a hosted model for a specific job? Cloud engines (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Qwen, Speechmatics) are available as **opt-in** — you add your own key, stored locally, and Wisp stays local everywhere else.

## 🍎 Tuned for Apple Silicon

Wisp doesn't just "run on a Mac" — it's optimized to the architecture:

- **Metal GPU inference** — the Whisper engine (whisper.cpp) executes on the GPU via Metal for large speedups over CPU.
- **Apple Neural Engine** — the Whisper encoder runs through **Core ML** so the heaviest stage lands on the **ANE**, freeing the GPU and CPU.
- **Unified Memory Architecture** — Apple Silicon's shared memory means **zero-copy** handoff between CPU, GPU, and ANE: no PCIe round-trips, lower latency, less power.
- **Apple SpeechAnalyzer** — on macOS 26, Wisp can use Apple's built-in on-device speech framework (ANE-accelerated, **zero model download**) as a first-class engine.
- **ScreenCaptureKit** — native, permissioned system-audio capture with no kernel extension.

The engine, model, and decoding cadence are **auto-selected to your machine** (cores, RAM, GPU/Neural-Engine tier), so it's fast out of the box and tunable when you want control.

## 🎛️ Yours to configure — not the other way around

No mandatory engine downloads. No forced multi-gigabyte "summary engine" gating you before you can start. Wisp runs immediately, and **you** decide what to add:

- **Pick any model** from the catalog — speed-first or accuracy-first — and switch per mode (Live vs File).
- **Import your own speech models** — select a sherpa-onnx `.onnx` graph or Whisper GGML/GGUF file; Wisp validates it and automatically brings along matching tokens, encoder/decoder/joiner graphs, and external weights.
- **Downloads that work across regions** — automatic Hugging Face/mirror failover, resumable partial files, bounded retries, and environment, HTTP, or SOCKS proxy support. Change the mirror or proxy live under **Settings → Model downloads**; the same policy covers transcription, speaker, denoise, Core ML, and embedding models.
- **Delete models** you don't need, right from the picker, to reclaim disk in one click.
- **Configure everything** — transcription language, accuracy/speed profile, VAD gating, denoising, decoding thresholds, diarization, custom vocabulary — instead of being locked to one preset.
- **Honest picker** — models your machine can't run are clearly marked, with size and hardware hints *before* you download.

## 🔌 Zero setup, no dependencies

- **macOS:** system audio via **ScreenCaptureKit** — *no BlackHole, no Loopback, no virtual audio device.*
- **Windows:** system audio via native **WASAPI loopback**.
- Microphone + meeting audio captured together, echo-cancelled, with one click. Install the app and start — that's the whole setup.

## 🪶 And more

- **Dictation** — global push-to-talk speech-to-text injected into *any* app via native text insertion.
- **Tiny installers** — 8 MB (Windows) / 22 MB (macOS); the ML runtime is the floor, models stream on demand.
- **Multilingual UI** — English, 简体中文, 繁體中文.
- **Cross-platform** — macOS (Apple Silicon) and Windows (x64), one codebase.
